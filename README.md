# TermKeyVault

Terminal password manager

## Warning ⚠️
TermKeyValut is still in development and is not ready for use. Do not have high expectations for this project.

## Description 📝
TermKeyValut is my side project to explore [F#](https://fsharp.org/), [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and how it works with [Terminal.Gui](https://github.com/gui-cs/Terminal.Gui). The idea is to create a password manager that is easy to use and can be used in the terminal.
It is by no means secure and if your main goal is to have a secure password manager, I would recommend using [KeePass](https://keepass.info/), from which I drew inspiration while developing this application.
